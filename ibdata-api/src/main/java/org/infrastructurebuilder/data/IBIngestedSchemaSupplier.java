/**
 *
 * The contract here is that an IBSchemaSupplier will supply all the required
 * data for the underlying persistence of an {@link IBSchema} as an
 * {@link IBSchemaDAO}
 * <p>
 * <b><i>Warning:</i></b> IBSchemaSupplier instances are intrinsically
 * dangerous. They provide relatively arbitrary data streams during ingestion,
 * and thus should be subject to as much scrutiny as is possible. If the system
 * is using schema supplies from outside of the InfrastructureBuilder project,
 * then results may be unpredictable.
 * <p>
 * A schema supplier implementation <b>must</b>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Persist the IBSchema instance underneath</li>
 * <li>Supply that persisted IBSchema file as an
 * {@link IBDataStreamSupplier}</li>
 * <li>Supply the mapped name of that IBDataStreamSupplier as a string in
 * {@code getPrimaryAssetName()}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A schema supplier implementation <b>should</b>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Provide a stream to the original inbound schema, if available, mapping
 * that to the key value provided by {@code getOriginalAssetName}
 * </ol>
 * <b>What this REALLY means</b>
 * <p>
 * {@link IBIngestedSchemaSupplier} instances or their producers must maintain
 * internal state. Once the {@code get} method is called, producing an
 * {@link IBSchema}, they must update any internal storage for
 * {@code getAssetSuppliers}.
