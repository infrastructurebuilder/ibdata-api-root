 * get() produces a direct Path representation of the schema asset.

 * The contract for this method is as follows: If the asset currently exists as
 * a path (i.e. getURL() represents a real Path on the filesystem, then this
 * method returns that value as a Path to a ReadOnly file.
 *
 * Otherwise, produce a path that contains the value pointed to by getURL as a
 * Path and return that value as a ReadOnly file.
 *
 * The value produced by get() must never be recaptured by the system.
 *
 * The value produced by get() is not guaranteed to be consistent
