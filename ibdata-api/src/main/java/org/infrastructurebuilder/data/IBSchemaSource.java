/**
 * An IBDataSource understands where a data stream originates and how to acquire
 * it. Furthermore, it actually acquires that datastream.
 *
 * An IBDataSource always returns {@link IBResource} which is a path to an
 * acquired file with type and a checksum. The contract for IBDataSource: 1. An
 * IBDataSource should produce the same value for a get() call every time. This
 * means cacheing the results 1. the Path supplied is to the same file every
 * time. 1. The list of {@link IBResource} is called for getMimeType(). This
 * should probably be removed.
